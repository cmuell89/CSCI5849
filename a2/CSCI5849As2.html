      <p>For this assignment we chose to test two different input methods, a mouse and a laptop touch screen. We tested 3 people starting with Carl Mueller, then Shiva Darian, and ending with Benjamin Lee.
          We did not alternate the order of conditions accross the participants, however the sample size of three people made it unlikely that we'd develop heuristics about each condition in the short testing 
        period. Our results showed inconsistency across each condition. No one scenario had a higher throughput across the board. I believe that this is due to the small sample size of participants and without
    further testing, we cannot claim any statistically significant results.</p>
